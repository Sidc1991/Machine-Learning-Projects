# Graphical Models

This repository contains material related to David Barber's book *Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning* which covers in depth the topics of graphical models and belief networks. 

The pdf to BRML book has been provided here along with a python implementation of his BRML toolbox (the original was implemented in matlab and Julia). The latest version of the book is available for free [here](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage).

This repository also covers lecture slides from [COMPGI08](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/syllabus/compgi/compgi08_graphical_models/) which was based on the first 12 chapters of BRML along with sampling chapters at the end of the book. The topics covered covered in the lecture slides are as follows:

## Content
Bayesian Reasoning

Bayesian Networks

Directed and Undirected Graphical Models

Inference in Singly-Connected Graphs

Hidden Markov Models

Junction Tree Algorithm

Decision Making under uncertainty

Markov Decision Processes

Learning with Missing Data

Approximate Inference using Sampling

The UCL Assignment folder contains a matlab implementation of junction tree and node search algorithm which was part of assignment 2's evaluation.

# Supplementary Resources

Another great read on graphical models is Michael Jordan's book on Graphical Models and Variational Inference which is provided in this repository. It covers much the same topics as BRML. 

## Online Course:

Daphne Koller's 3 part Probabilistic Graphical Models course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) is probably the second best certificate one can get on the platform after Andrew Ng's deep learning course. Koller has an extremely intuitional approach to these complex topics and should be easy to grasp for anyone with necessary pre-requisites.
