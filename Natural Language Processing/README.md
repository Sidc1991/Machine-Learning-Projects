# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the code for biomedical event extraction from research papers. This was done as a part of [COMP0087](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/?id=9944) Statistical Natural Language Processing module at UCL.

The notebook, data, and exercises are based on Sebastian Riedel's interactive notes which can be seen here: https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book

Use his docker installation before attempting the code. 

# Supplementary Resources:

Additionally uploaded Dan Jurafsky's Speech and Learning processing book for an excellent overview of different NLP applications. A youtube playlist of his course covering this book can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiyVNMpDLKnZYBTUOlSI9mi9wAErFtFm).
