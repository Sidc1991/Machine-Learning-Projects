# Deep Learning

The TensorFlow Practice repository contains some practice code for implementing deep learning models (NN, DNN Autoencoders, CNN, RNN) in TenserFlow. The code is implemented along with notes on TensorFlow library in Jupyter Notebooks. The notes are mainly taken from Aurélien Géron's excellent book [*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*.](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) 

This repository also contains Géron's original implementation in the Hands on Machine Learning folder.

An implementation of neural networks without DL libraries is available in the UCL Assignments folder along with an alternate implementation in PyTorch.

Supplementary material in the form of Goodfellow's excellent book *Deep Learning* is provided for theoretical and mathematical explanation of various Deep Learning topics.
