# Deep Learning

The TensorFlow Practice repository contains some practice code for implementing deep learning models (NN, DNN Autoencoders, CNN, RNN) in TenserFlow. The code is implemented along with notes on TensorFlow library in Jupyter Notebooks. The notes are mainly taken from Aurélien Géron's excellent book [*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*.](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) 

This repository also contains Géron's original implementation in the Hands on Machine Learning folder.

An implementation of neural networks without DL libraries is available in the UCL Assignments folder along with an alternate implementation in PyTorch. 

Research paper on Transfer Learning in the field of vision analyzing CNN and VGG model performances on Amazon deforestation dataset is also available here.

Supplementary material in the form of Goodfellow's excellent book *Deep Learning* is provided for theoretical and mathematical explanation of various Deep Learning topics.

# Supplementary Resources

To further understand implementational aspects of DL models there probably isn't a better course out there than Stanford's [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

For a more beginner friendly approach to DL: Andrew Ng's 5 part [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) speicialization is the way to go (or search youtube for the playlist of his course). 

A deeper explanation of mathematical aspects of DL is available on Hugo Larochelle's youtube playlist [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH)
