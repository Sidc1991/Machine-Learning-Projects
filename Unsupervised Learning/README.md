# Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains unsupervised learning algorithms used in machine learning. A total of 5 unsupervised learning topics have been covered here: Clustering, PCA, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders.

The clustering folder contains code for implementing various clustering algorithms in R along with a reference book *Practical Guide to Cluster Analysis in R*:

Code from this book has been implemented in the sample code folder. The topics covered are:
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- Partition Around Medoids
- Dendrograms
- Heat maps

Exercise sheets from first half of STATG019 module have also been uploaded which extensively looked at clustering algorithms and the underlying distance measures defining it.

For detailed notes on theory behind cluster analysis and supplementary material to solve the problem sheets it's worth looking at Christian Hennig's extremely extremely (not a typo) well written [**handbook**](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakche/presentations/g19lecnotes.pdf). 

One of his lectures can also be seen on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf6MqIS2ql4)

The UCL assignment folder contains finished Python implementation of gaussian mixture models, K-Means, PCA and autoencoders.
