# Algorithmic Trading with R

Surprisingly, there are few resources that take you through the entire automated trading process from querying stock indices to data processing and then implementing strategy onto a trading platform. The most indepth book I found (that isn't in C++) is Chris Conlan's Automated Trading with R: Quantitative Research and Platform Development.

**Unfortunately**, this book became outdated pretty quickly as the yahoo APIs along with some code formatting in R changed. I have updated the code till chapter 7 (Simulation and Backtesting) of this book. Haven't had a chance to come back and update the remaining 3 chapters.
