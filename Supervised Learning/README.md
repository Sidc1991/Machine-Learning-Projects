# Supervised Learning

This repository contains the finished assignments from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course on coursera. Other than K-Means and PCA, the remaining topics covered belong in the domain of supervised learning. All code is written in Octave but Matlab can also be used as an alternative.

Additionally, I have included notes from the second half of STATG019 module at UCL which covers model validation and generalized errors - very important topics not covered in detail during the course. 

# Supplementary Material

Andrew Ng's machine learning course is beginner friendly and intuitive but for a more rigorous treatment of the topics in this course it is worth going over his course notes from [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) at Stanford. This gives a far more holistic view of the topics covered.
